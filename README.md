# LiRibo-seq

Snakemake pipelines for analyzing:

- LiRibo-seq : for analyzing ribosome profiling data generated by SMARTer® smRNA-Seq Kit. The first 3nt of the read (Read 1) are derived from the template-switching oligo and would be trimmed. The read 1 is from the sense strand.

- total RNA-seq : for analyzing total RNA-seq data generated by SMART-Seq® Stranded Kit. The first 3nt of the second read (Read 2) are derived from the template-switching oligo and would be trimmed. The read 1 is antisense to the original RNA.
